# Outline

Title: How Long Until Your College Degree Pays for Itself?

College is one of the biggest financial decisions young adults make, yet students often select majors or schools without understanding how long it takes for their educational investment to pay off. This project visualizes the payback period of a U.S. college degree — defined as the number of years it takes for cumulative earnings to surpass the total cost of attendance.

My goal is to help audiences such as high school students, families, and college counselors make more informed choices by showing how payback varies dramatically across majors and institutions, even when degrees cost similar amounts. This project aims to reveal where the value of college is highest, where it is lowest, and how equity factors may influence outcomes.

Hook — The Problem

College is expensive, but financial outcomes vary dramatically.
“Is college worth it?” is too vague; what matters is when it pays back.
Insight — Introducing the Payback Period

“Years until earnings recoup cost of attendance” as an intuitive measure of return.
Evidence — Visual Comparisons

Majors ranked by fastest vs slowest payback periods
School-level variation
STEM vs Business vs Arts comparison
Interpretation — Why These Patterns Occur

Wages, tuition, and living costs drive differences
Some expensive schools compensate with high earnings; others do not
Call to Action — What People Can Do

Students can weigh debt risk vs. return
Policymakers / institutions can improve transparency
