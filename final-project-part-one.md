# Outline
Hook — The Problem

College is expensive, but financial outcomes vary dramatically.
“Is college worth it?” is too vague; what matters is when it pays back.
Insight — Introducing the Payback Period

“Years until earnings recoup cost of attendance” as an intuitive measure of return.
Evidence — Visual Comparisons

Majors ranked by fastest vs slowest payback periods
School-level variation
STEM vs Business vs Arts comparison
Interpretation — Why These Patterns Occur

Wages, tuition, and living costs drive differences
Some expensive schools compensate with high earnings; others do not
Call to Action — What People Can Do

Students can weigh debt risk vs. return
Policymakers / institutions can improve transparency
