# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

Here's my part II Shorthand preview: https://preview.shorthand.com/ZfNoYx2Zt2Rg67Qb

# User research 

## Target audience
This story is designed for new college students who are in the process of choosing a major. These are typically first-year undergraduates or incoming freshmen who may still be exploring academic paths and trying to balance personal interests, career goals, and financial considerations.

To identify representative individuals, I focused on:

Students who have not yet committed to a major or recently declared one

Students who feel uncertain or overwhelmed by the financial impact of their decision

Students comparing passion-driven majors (arts, humanities, social sciences) with traditionally high-earning majors (engineering, business, CS)

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Understand how new college students make decisions about majors    | What influenced your major choice?                 |
|  Identify awareness of student debt and payback periods    |          How do you feel about student loans?       |
|    Evaluate whether financial data impacts decisions  |         After seeing payback-period data, do you feel more or less confident about your major choice? Would this information change anything for you?         |


## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What influenced your major choice? | Followed passion but felt unsure about job stability; didn’t think about debt when deciding            |     Picked based on employability; compared job prospects across majors        |      Family encouraged “practical” major; student unsure whether they actually like it       |How do you feel about student loans?
|        Very concerned but unsure how repayment works                 |          Believes loans are manageable if salary is high                      |       Avoids thinking about loans because it feels overwhelming      |     After seeing payback-period data, do you feel more or less confident about your major choice? Would this information change anything for you?          |Yes — would have compared across majors
|          Yes — might reconsider concentration within major               |                Yes — wants to align passion with a financially realistic plan                |             |             |


# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

Based on interview feedback, students responded strongly to the visualizations but emphasized a desire for more guidance on how to interpret the charts and what the information means for real decision-making. Several participants mentioned that the charts were interesting but felt “a little overwhelming” without context, and all three said they would appreciate clearer takeaways and next steps for students choosing majors. To address this, Part III will focus on improving clarity, pacing, and practical value for new college students.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Students felt unsure how to interpret some graphs without explanation |Add short takeaway captions directly beneath each visualization and highlight key numbers within the graphs| Students wanted more actionable guidance, not only data
|            Add a final section titled “How to use this information when choosing a major” with 3–5 bullet points for decision-making                              |                                                                                 |
|                                          |                                                                                 |
|                                          |                                                                                 
                                                                             |
