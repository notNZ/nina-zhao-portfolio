# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
Since completing Part II, I made several key changes to strengthen both the clarity of my narrative and the effectiveness of my visualizations. First, I refined my story structure to create a smoother flow from the introduction to the final call-to-action. This included rewriting sections to be more concise, removing excessive numerical details, and emphasizing the emotional and practical implications of choosing a major. 

I also redesigned multiple charts based on instructor and TA feedback. I clarified titles, added contextual explanations, cited the sources, and adjusted color palettes to highlight the most important takeaways. I annotated the outliners for the two scatterplots to clearly show the distinction between majors in regards to payback periods. 

Finally, I incorporated a stronger call-to-action Checklist by adding resources such as major-to-career guides and college planning tools.  These additions ensure that the story does not simply present data, but empowers students to make more informed decisions about their futures.


## The audience
The primary audience for my final data story is college students, specifically those who have not yet chosen a major or who are unsure about the long-term consequences of their choice. Through my interviews, I learned that many students choose majors based on passion, familiarity, or peer influence, but very few understand how different majors translate into debt, payback periods, and early career earnings. Several interviewees admitted they didn’t even know what “loan repayment period” meant. This reinforced the need for a story that is clear, visual, and accessible, rather than technical or overwhelming.

To make the project work for this audience, I intentionally avoided jargon and focused on storytelling. I used student-oriented imagery and included relatable examples that reflect the anxieties students shared during interview. I also added a practical section at the end that points students toward resources like major-to-career guides and financial planning tools.


## Final design decisions
Throughout this project, I made several intentional design choices to balance storytelling with analytical depth. One major decision was using soft, consistent color palettes to ensure the visuals felt approachable rather than technical or intimidating. Another was simplifying the charts: instead of showing every possible comparison, I selected only the visuals that directly supported the story’s narrative.

I also chose to highlight only a few key outliers rather than labeling the entire dataset. This helps guide the viewer's attention without cluttering the visuals. In addition, I used layout decisions in Shorthand like large section headers, whitespace, and quotes to break up the story and create natural emotional beats.

From a storytelling perspective, I learned the importance of limiting numbers and telling a story through complex data. Rather than overwhelming readers with data, I reframed insights by incorporating interview feedback and my audience's needs. This process taught me how design, narrative, and data work together, and how removing elements can be just as impactful as adding them.

# Final thoughts
I really enjoyed this project - the process of building a story from scratch using a complex dataset. I love the process of refining my approaches during this process and tailoring my data and story to my audience. One challenge I faced was that there was not enough time for Part II. I had troubles with Tableau and Excel data cleaning. Fortunately I was able to finish and refine them in Part III. Overall, I had fun with this project, and I hope to continue with my telling stories with data journey in my future career.
