# Title
_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

Murray, Caitlin. “Revealed: the $730,000 gender pay gap in US World Cup bonuses.” The Guardian, 28 June 2019. Available at: https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jun/28/revealed-the-731003-gender-pay-gap-in-us-world-cup-bonuses

I was drawn to this data visualization because I’m personally interested in gender pay gaps and their impact on female athletes. The interactive design by The Guardian illustrates how the U.S. Women’s National Team earns significantly less than their male counterparts, even when achieving the same or better results in the World Cup. The cumulative circle animation, where earnings build as I scroll, clearly communicates the scale of inequality while maintaining an engaging storytelling style. It not only visualizes the numbers but also emphasizes the broader issue of gender equity in professional sports—making it both informative and emotionally compelling for readers like me who care about fairness and representation in athletics.

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1763007023457');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
