*Murray, Caitlin. “Revealed: the $730,000 gender pay gap in US World Cup bonuses.” The Guardian, 28 June 2019. Available at: https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jun/28/revealed-the-731003-gender-pay-gap-in-us-world-cup-bonuses*

I was drawn to this data visualization because I’m personally interested in gender pay gaps and their impact on female athletes. The interactive design by The Guardian illustrates how the U.S. Women’s National Team earns significantly less than their male counterparts, even when achieving the same or better results in the World Cup. The cumulative circle animation, where earnings build as I scroll, clearly communicates the scale of inequality while maintaining an engaging storytelling style. It not only visualizes the numbers but also emphasizes the broader issue of gender equity in professional sports—making it both informative and emotionally compelling for readers like me who care about fairness and representation in athletics.

## Step two: the critique
I chose The Guardian’s interactive data visualization “Revealed: the $730,000 gender pay gap in US World Cup bonuses” because it effectively combines storytelling and data to highlight gender inequity in sports. The visualization uses two cumulative circles — blue for female players and orange for male players — to represent per-person earnings throughout the World Cup season. I found the scrolling animation particularly engaging, as it gradually adds each earning stage and allows viewers to see how the gap widens. The contrast in colors and motion makes the message visually striking and easy to follow, helping the audience understand the issue of unequal pay in a compelling and accessible way.

However, while the interactivity works well, I found the use of circles somewhat misleading since the changing areas don’t accurately represent proportional differences. The gap between $90,000 and $200,000, for example, doesn’t visually double as it should. In my redesign, I focused on improving proportional accuracy and clarity by replacing circles with horizontal bar charts that better represent data in each segment. I’m excited to experiment with a design that preserves the narrative flow of the original while offering a clearer, more accurate representation of gender pay inequality in sports.

## Step three: Sketch a solution
I did two sketches with one changing the format to horizontal bars, while the other one focuses on the underpaid gap between female and male soccer players.

For the first sketch, I focused on the comparison between female and male soccer player's individual pay.

For the second sketch, I followed a makeover reference video and focused on the difference between female and male players' pay by changing the entire structure.

## Step four: Test the solution

I conducted an interview to three classmates regarding my initial design surrounding the following questions; 

- What is your initial thought after seeing the graphs?

- Which one do you prefer and why?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
  

Results: 

Interview 1: MSHCA - 27
I really like that you chose the horizontal layout — it makes the visualization much easier to read and compare across categories. However, some of the text is still a bit hard to read, so adjusting the font size or placement could improve clarity. I’d also suggest changing the title to make it sound more like a story and draw the viewer in. The color scheme feels a little unconventional, so it might help to use more intuitive color coding, especially for the “Total Pay” section, which could also be highlighted or separated visually to stand out as the main takeaway. You could also consider inverting the order of female and male and including the year to give more context and consistency to the comparison.

Interview 2, MSPPM - 24
I think your horizontal version works really well — it’s much easier to follow and compare across categories. The stacked bar chart format is also a strong choice because it clearly shows how each stage contributes to the total. To make the differences between male and female even clearer, you could increase the color contrast — for example, keeping the female color vibrant while making the male bars gray. This would help emphasize the focus on female earnings and make the overall comparison stand out more effectively.

Interview 3, MSPPM - 23
I agree that the horizontal version looks better — it’s easier to read and visually cleaner. One small adjustment I’d suggest is to change the contrast for the “Total Pay” section again, so it stands out more clearly from the other categories. Making that contrast stronger would help draw attention to the key takeaway and make the visualization feel more balanced overall.

From the peer feedback, a few clear patterns emerged. All of them agreed that the horizontal version was easier to read and allowed for better comparison across categories, which confirmed my decision to use that layout in my redesign. They also emphasized the importance of clear color contrast to distinguish male and female earnings and suggested making the “Total Pay” section stand out more. I learned that even small design choices, like text alignment and color tone, can strongly affect readability and focus. Based on this feedback, I plan to increase the contrast in the “Total Pay” bar, refine the color palette by keeping women’s bars vibrant and men’s bars neutral gray, and ensure the labels remain easy to read. These adjustments will make the visualization both more accessible and more impactful in communicating the gender pay gap story.

## Step five: build the solution

  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1763007023457');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

My final redesign focuses on improving clarity, proportional accuracy, and storytelling in visualizing the gender pay gap between male and female U.S. soccer players in the World Cup. Using Tableau, I created a horizontal bar chart that clearly compares earnings for each stage of the tournament, from qualifying to total pay. This layout makes it much easier for viewers to read and compare values side by side. I used orange for women and gray for men, following peer feedback to make the female data stand out while keeping the male data neutral for contrast. I also highlighted the “Total Pay” row by adjusting spacing and color intensity so it stands out as the main takeaway.

Overall, the redesign process helped me better understand how visual choices shape audience interpretation. Through feedback, I learned that accurate proportions and consistent color coding are just as important as visual appeal. The final chart communicates the gender pay disparity more effectively than the original circle-based design, while keeping the data storytelling clear, proportional, and accessible to all viewers.

Looking ahead, I could further develop this visualization by adding stronger emphasis to the “Total Pay” category, such as bolding the text, using a distinctive outline, or introducing a small gap to visually separate it from the other categories. I might also experiment with interactive features, like tooltips that show the difference in earnings in dollars or percentages, or an equal-pay simulation toggle that lets viewers see what the women’s bonuses would look like if paid at the same rate as the men’s. These enhancements would make the visualization even more engaging and deepen the audience’s understanding of the gender pay gap story.
