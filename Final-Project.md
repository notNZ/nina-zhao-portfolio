# Final Project — Part I  
**Title: How Long Until Your College Degree Pays for Itself?**

College is one of the biggest financial decisions young adults make, yet students often select majors or schools without understanding how long it takes for their educational 
investment to pay off. This project visualizes the **payback period of a U.S. college degree** — defined as the number of years it takes for cumulative earnings to surpass the 
total cost of attendance.

My goal is to help audiences such as high school students, families, and college counselors make more informed choices by showing how **payback varies dramatically across majors 
and institutions**, even when degrees cost similar amounts. This project aims to reveal where the value of college is highest, where it is lowest, and how equity factors may influence 
outcomes.

## Outline
The story will follow a narrative structure aligned with *Good Charts* and the in-class Story Arc activity:

1. **Hook — The Problem**
   - College is expensive, but financial outcomes vary dramatically.
   - “Is college worth it?” is too vague; what matters is *when it pays back*.

2. **Insight — Introducing the Payback Period**
   - “Years until earnings recoup cost of attendance” as an intuitive measure of return.

3. **Evidence — Visual Comparisons**
   - Majors ranked by fastest vs slowest payback periods
   - School-level variation (some public universities outperform elite schools)
   - STEM vs Business vs Arts comparison
   - Pell-recipient payback gap (equity dimension)

4. **Interpretation — Why These Patterns Occur**
   - Wages, tuition, and living costs drive differences
   - Some expensive schools compensate with high earnings; others do not

5. **Call to Action — What People Can Do**
   - Students can weigh debt risk vs. return
   - Policymakers / institutions can improve transparency
